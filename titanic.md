## Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves predicting passenger survival using Machine Learning algorithms. I explored various algorithms and evaluation metrics to achieve optimal results. Key highlights include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Implementing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Sand Seaborn.

The full implementation of the Titanic Survival Prediction project is available in the following notebook
